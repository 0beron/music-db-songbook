               <span>Headin' for the station with a pack on my back</span>
               <span>I'm tired of transportation in the back of my hack</span>
               <span>I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack</span>
               <span>And hear the lonesome whistle see the smoke from the stack to pal around</span>
               <span>With democratic fellow named mac</span>
               <span>So take me right back to the track, jack</span>

               <span>You reach your destination but alas and alack</span>

               <span>You take a morning paper from the top of the stack</span>
               <span>And read the situations from the front to the back</span>

               <span>My baby's always dancin'; And it wouldn't be a bad thing</span>
               <span>But I don't get no loving; And thats no lie</span>
               <span>We spent the night in Frisco; At every kind of disco</span>
               <span>From that night I kissed; Our love goodbye</span>

               <span>Way back up on the woods among the evergreens</span>
               <span>There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood</span>
               <span>Where lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode</span>
               <span>Who'd never ever learned to read or write so well</span>
               <span>But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell</span>

               <span>Old engineers in the train would see him him sittin' in the shade</span>
               <span>Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made</span>
